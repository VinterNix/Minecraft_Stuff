# Minecraft_Stuff
Just a random collection of scripts we have developed and use in-house for running our MC Network. Feel free to use and share, if you need help join https://discord.jellymc.co


# paper_updater.sh
Script for automating the downloading and updating of our PaperMC Minecraft servers.
This script has been designed to work with our Puffer node system running (Java MC v1.15.2), but can be tweaked to meet your needs, keep this in mind when editing! PaperMC uses a Restful API for their download system.
